Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Okay, this has been a humbling lesson in sunk cost fallacy. I definitely should have given more thought to how my class was going to implement the methods in the interface, but I got a little bit too excited. 
My class Dodo only really is useful in the context of the little (probably still broken) game I created, and a lot of the methods are a little bit of a work around/convoluted because I didn't pay very close attention to the parameters or return type when I conceptulized the implementation. I think it works mostly though in the game, there are a few surprising/unintended side effects/errors, but I think I caught all the ones I could find? But I left it as "part" in the rubric because I was untrusting of my code. 
This is DEFINITELY not a finalized finished version and it doesn't work completely how I want it to rip. :(
I think I caught/handled most of my exceptions properly, but there are definitely places where I should've been more specific about the type of exception or handled it differently in the main. 

What worked was trying to implement the methods one by one and testing them to make sure they worked how I expected before moving on to the other methods. What didn't work was literally everything else in my planning process. I would advise people to maybe think a little bit longer than I did before writing their code, and to have the strength to give up on an idea that probably isn't well suited to the assignment. 

I added a lot of additional methods to my dodo class mostly as getters for attributes and one for showOptions that prints out the available commands (that the user can do in the game).
