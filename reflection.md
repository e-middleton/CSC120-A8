Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Okay, this has been a humbling lesson in sunk cost fallacy. I definitely should have given more thought to how my class was going to implement the methods in the interface, but I got a little bit too excited. 
My class Dodo only really is useful in the context of the little (probably still broken) game I created, and a lot of the methods are a little bit of a work around/convoluted because I didn't pay very close attention to the parameters or return type when I conceptulized the implementation. 

What worked was trying to implement the methods one by one and testing them to make sure they worked how I expected before moving on to the other methods. What didn't work was literally everything else in my planning process. I would advise people to maybe think a little bit longer than I did before writing their code, and to have the strength to give up on an idea that probably isn't well suited to the assignment.
